          I'm an enthusiastic and motivated learner. I became interested in
          coding and programming at a young age, as my older brother went to
          university for computer science and later he specialized in 3D
          modeling. I was always trying to look over his shoulder to learn a bit
          more about it myself.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Two years ago I was inspired by a Youtube video about a self-taught
          dev who explained their professional and personal journey. From that
          moment I knew that I would be a dev one day.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          I spent a couple of months working on my skills throuh
          FreeCodeCamp.com, CodeWithMosh.com, Stack Overflow, Youtube.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consistently challenge myself and solve problems on my own to
          improve my skills, only looking for support if necessary.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          I am looking for my first job in a team environment with a mentor who
          can support me in further professional development.
        </p>
        <p>The challenge of coding is for me fun and I love it!</p>
